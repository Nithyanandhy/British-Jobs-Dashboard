# British-Jobs-Dashboard Visualization using Tableau

This repository contains data visualization dashboard created using Tableau, focusing on the British Jobs Data in Excel. The visualizations provide insights into various aspects of the job market from 2011 to 2014 in Britain.

## About the Project

The goal of this project is to explore and analyze the British Jobs Dataset using Tableau visualizations. By creating informative and interactive visualizations, we aim to uncover trends, patterns, and insights related to the job market from 2011 to 2014 in Britain.

## Data Source

The dataset used for this project is https://public.tableau.com/app/sample-data/EMSI_JobChange_UK.xlsx, which provides Employment data by industry for 2011 and 2014 by city for Great Britain. The 1-digit sheet has data aggregated at the industry level, whereas the 2-digit sheet aggregates the data at the sub-industry level. The dataset is a valuable resource for understanding the dynamics of the job market from 2011 to 2014 in the UK.
